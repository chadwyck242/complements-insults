# complements-insults
Complements and Insults project for Brian Holt's "Intro to Web Dev v2" on Front End Masters

## Description
A simple little project to demonstrate Node.js and Express, and the concept of a web server. 
Project for this section of the class was just to extend the Complements app to also
include an Insults route, as well as trying to use Parcel to bundle the app and add some CSS
styling.

This frontend application now will do the Insults as well as Complements, and had some build performed with Parcel.
The styling was completed using Semantic UI.

### Requirements
You will need to have Node.js installed. Clone the project, then run `npm install` in the root directory. Then you can start
the project with `node server.js`, and open the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
